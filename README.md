## Description:


## Setup/ Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g. Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "SweetSavory" and create a new file called appsettings.json.
3. Within the appsettings.json file, add this line of code: { "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=sweet_savory_database;uid=[your user id];pwd=[your password];"}}
4. The database structure for this project is stored in the Migrations directory. While still in the production directory ("SweetSavory"), run the command "dotnet ef database update" to automatically recreate the databse on your SQL server. Note: you will need to have dotnet-ef globally installed to utilize this tool. To do so, type in "dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0" into your terminal. This is a visual representation of the database: ![database schema](./SweetSavory/wwwroot/img/Database_Schema.png)
5. While in the production folder of this application ("SweetSavory"), in the command line, run the command "dotnet watch run" to compile and execute the application.
